Overview: SUPER TRANSFORMING ISLAND DELUXE OF GREAT GOOD takes place in a mysterious sinking temple. The player moves from room to room, collecting items and searching for the temple's secret, most valuable item. The player will encounter barriers which must be overcome by transforming into different animal forms. Forms are unlocked by picking up corresponding animal tokens.


Input: The player will input commands, generally a single digit or character at a time.

Example input: 'W' to move west


Output:   The program will narrate the player's journey through the temple.

Example output:

The temple feels unsteady. You estimate you can take about 80 more actions until it slips back into the sea.

This room is mostly dry and well-lit. You appear to be alone.
